Videotape is an online commenting tool for your website that supports both text and video comments.

== Description ==

Videotape is the first online commenting tool that supports both text and video comments. A simple integration on any page allows your audience to join the discussion by contributing their own content. Text and video comments can be uploaded directly to the comment thread on your website, or users can download our free app for iOS to record and import video comments on the fly.

Post videos on your website? Add the video URL to the Videotape shortcode to allow your audience to make video comments right inside your video. With the tap of a button, your video will be downloaded to the Videotape mobile app, where video comments and voiceovers can be added to it for full video-on-video interaction.

Videotape’s mission is to allow a website’s audience to be able to contribute their own content in a quick, simple way. That’s why we’ve built the Videotape web commenting tool and paired it with the Videotape mobile app, which allows anyone to record and post video comments as easily as sending a video on Snapchat.

Each user signs in with Facebook, which provides links to their public Facebook profiles and reduces spam and abusive content. For further concern about content moderation and full access, please email info@videotape.co.

Our mobile app is a tool designed for creating exciting mobile video content for your website’s commenting thread. When a user logs in to post on your thread and logs in on their Videotape app, they can create dynamic, on-the-go directly from their mobile device.

Install the Videotape plugin so your website can explode with shareable audience-generated video content
